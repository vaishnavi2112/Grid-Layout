   green paddy fields and coconut trees lining the coastal streets. Goa - a place you can fall in love with at 
   first glance. There's much more to Goa than sun, sand and sea. The allure of Goa is that it remains quite distinct 
   from the rest of India and is small enough to be grasped and explored in a way that other Indian states are not.
    Ruled by the Portuguese till 1961, Goa still retains its indo-portuguese character -- very visible amongst its 
    architecture as well as its people.</p> </div>

        <div class="modal-body">This is one of the most frequented places for sightseeing in Goa. The lovely church which stands tall in the capital city of Goa has had a long tryst with the past. It was first built as a chapel in 1541.
          Over this chapel, the larger building of the church was then constructed in 1619. It has since undergone many revisions, but the original building has remained. It draws devotees from all over the globe and has been a spiritual and geographical landmark for centuries.

          Old Portuguese sailors who crossed the perilous seas safely and landed at Goa would pay their first thanks at this church. Today, this church is a gorgeous white landmark in Panaji with a lovely multicoloured interior that at once imparts peace and delight. It is at its best in December as the feast of Our lady of immaculate conception is celebrated on 8th of December followed by the Christmas and New year celebrations.
          
          If you’re in Panaji even for a couple of hours at any time of the year, drop by this church and simply revel in the silence within its walls.

              The Dudhsagar Waterfalls are situated on the Goa-Karnataka border and are one of India’s must-see sights. The four-tiered waterfall structure is one of the tallest in India and is located on the Mandovi River.
              The white water cascades down from a height of nearly 1017 feet off a nearly steep mountain face. They form a part of the Bhagwan Mahaveer Sanctuary and Mollem National Park, so the best way to reach them is by entering the national park and taking a van allocated by the park to the falls.
              The Dudhsagar trek inside the park is closed to the public but you can still reach the waterfalls by trekking from Kulem and following the jeep trail. Another possible route is the trek from Castle Rock in Karnataka. Reaching the waterfalls will not be an easy task but it is one that is worth every ounce of effort put into it.  They are best experienced during the monsoons as they lose their force during the dry season.
              Many tours are organized over this time so you can choose to go as a part of a group. Some tours even have overnight camping options. But remember to go well-prepared to ensure a good experience, especially if you are going on a self-organized trek. The lush green jungle and the beautiful waterfall sending up their forceful sprays are a sight to remember long after you have left Dudhsagar behind.

              Another heritage from the Portuguese, Fort Aguada has been standing stern on the beach facing the Arabian Sea from 1612 when it was built in order to provide defence against the invading Dutch and the Marathas.
       It was a grand old fort in its time with the capacity to hold 79 cannons among other weapons of defense. It was one of the prized possessions of the Portuguese. Today, it stands as famous Goa sightseeing places dividing the Sinquerium Beach and Candolim Beach.

There is an old lighthouse standing within the fort which was built in 1864, the oldest lighthouse of its shape and size in India. Fort Aguada is a great place to explore when you are out visiting the Candolim or Sinquerium Beaches. The architecture gives a good insight into the building techniques of old Portuguese architects and it has some amazing views you should really see. The old fort provides a good view of the sea and the sunset is reckoned to be lovely.

The fort is a great way to spend an afternoon. Afternoons are usually too hot to spend on the beach. But you don’t want to be cooped up in your hotel room when in Goa. So, head over to Fort Aguada and spend your time exploring it. Once you’re done, you can simply sit down and enjoy the sea breezes as you let the afternoon pass by. And then you can head over to either of the two beaches that strike your fancy in the evening. It makes the perfect resting point during your tour of the beaches in North Goa

    <p>There is no dearth of water related activities in Goa, of course. But while the different beaches up and down Goa offer tourists many options, these options are not to be found all in one place. <span class="dots">...</span>
      <span class="more" style="display: none;">
        so in grand island. Grand Island is the nirvana of Goan water-sports. There is a lot to be experienced here from diving to snorkelling to fishing. Scuba diving in Goa is the most popular activity because it offers so much in terms of underwater exploration.

        There are ship wrecks to be found here as well as some reefs. The “Suzy” wreck and the “Davy Jones Locker” are especially popular with divers as are Serge City, Bounty Rock, and Turbo Tunnel. Experienced and beginner divers both find something to satisfy in Grand Island. You can also go snorkelling. Professional instructors will provide the equipment and the instructions. Bumper boats and banana boats are also popular around the island.
        
        End the day with a fishing trip and a barbeque of the produce you caught. A day trip usually lasts from 8.30am to 4 pm but it can be negotiated beforehand. If you want an in-depth underwater experience, Grand Island is one of the places to visit in Goa. You will come back from your trip exhausted but well-satisfied with your day. Make sure to carry all your swimming and beach essentials as well as spare clothes for the day.

                      This is a little out of the way thing you can indulge in when in Goa. A Casino Cruise is essential, at the basic level, a restaurant, but with the additional casino features for those who want to try a hand at Vegas style entertainment. The ship is docked on one of the many rivers in Goa and is fitted with posh furnishings. The view outside and the rooms inside both make for a great set-up. The casinos are open all round the clock but they really come to life in the night from 9 pm to 3 pm. They are like clubs but instead of the DJ and the party music, you have casino games and low music. They are well-fitted spaces with fine dining options in place including a good selection of drinks.

                      The visitors can stay on board for up to 12 hours and enjoy the ambiance of the cruise. If you are lucky, you might even end up slightly richer when you come out of the Casino Cruise. Some places even have playrooms for children in case you want to take them along. The tickets are slightly expensive but seeing that they come inclusive of the provision of food and drinks as well as the various other entertainments apart from the casino rooms.
                      
                      There are dance shows and ball rooms and lovely decks where you can hear the river waters dapple against the ship. If you are visiting Goa as a honeymooning couple, this is a very romantic place to be. There are many Casino Cruises in Goa like Deltin Royale Casino, Casino Pride, Casino Royale, Casino Carnival etc. Most are located close to Panaji.

              One such wonder is the heart-shaped lagoon in Chicolna near Bogmalo beach in the south. With cerulean waters and its extraordinary shape, it twinkles under the sun inviting you to take a cool dip.
              Take a drive all the way down to the end of the road beyond the turnoff for Bogmalo beach. The lagoon is, literally, off the beaten track. Your best hope for the trek is good sports shoes since the trail is a little rocky. You’ll find a fork in the road where you can either choose to go up or down a path, like in any nail-biting book featuring forked roads.

                      Arambol Beach is located in North Goa and first became popular when people came to it in order to escape  Baga and Calangute beach crowd. Today it is famous in its own right and draws several tourists, though not in the quantity that Baga and Calangute do. This is a good beach to visit if you are searching for a place that combines adventure sports in Goa with relaxation. The strong winds on the headlands around the beach make it an ideal spot for paragliding and kitesurfing.

          These sports are more well-known on the Arambol scene than the water sports which characterize the other beaches of Goa. The village of Arambol is a little distance away so you can get a feel of authentic local life if you step by the house sometime. Accommodation is available in the many huts that have come up around the beach and the food options around the place are many and varied owing to the numerous shacks that line the beach. If you want to step away from the crowd for a bit, you can walk onwards to Mandrem to the south. Kalacha Beach, north of Arambol, is where the best paragliding in Goa takes place.
          
          A verdant jungle near the beach makes for a good trekking option in Goa. Depending upon the time of the year, you can go swimming in the sea too. The Arambol “Sweetwater lake” and the banyan tree on the hilltop can be counted upon as its best sights. You might even catch the Tribal Dance Convention or the Annual Juggling Convention taking place here if you are lucky. A variety of musicians from India and abroad also tend to gather here, making it a good music destination too.
